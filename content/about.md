I am the co-founder and Group CTO of Theodo, a lean software consultancy whose mission is to transform organisations - from start-ups to large companies - to build better digital experiences and become tech leaders in their market.

After discovering in 2010 the power of scrum and devops in helping tech teams deliver better products faster, the challenge has been to scale agile to the whole organisation and I have been on a lean journey ever since. Seven years of coaching by lean senseis and 4 trips to Toyota factories in Japan later, Theodo is now a group of 8 startups with 300+ people in Paris, London, New York and Casablanca.

In my spare time I try to automate my house way beyond what is reasonable.

I studied Computer Science at Ecole Polytechnique Paris and ETH ZÃ¼rich.
